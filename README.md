Event Contract
This is a smart contract written in Solidity that represents an Event Contract. The contract allows creating events by specifying their details, such as name, date, price, and ticket count. It also allows buying and transferring tickets to events.

How to Use
To use the Event Contract, you need to compile and deploy it to the Ethereum network. You can use a Solidity compiler, such as Remix, to compile the contract code into bytecode. Then, you can use a tool like Truffle or Remix to deploy the contract to a local or public Ethereum network.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it using a web3-enabled Ethereum wallet, such as MetaMask. You can call the following functions on the contract:

createEvent
This function allows creating a new event by specifying its name, date, price, and ticket count. The function can be called by anyone, but the event's organizer will be set to the address that calls the function. The function takes the following parameters:

name (string): The name of the event.
date (uint): The date of the event in Unix timestamp format.
price (uint): The price of each ticket in Ether.
ticketCount (uint): The total number of tickets available for the event.
buyTicket
This function allows buying tickets for an existing event by sending the correct amount of Ether to the contract. The function takes the following parameters:

id (uint): The ID of the event to buy tickets for.
quantity (uint): The number of tickets to buy.
transferTicket
This function allows transferring tickets to an existing event from one address to another. The function takes the following parameters:

id (uint): The ID of the event to transfer tickets for.
quantity (uint): The number of tickets to transfer.
to (address): The address to transfer the tickets to.
